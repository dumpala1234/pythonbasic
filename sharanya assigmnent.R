#1: - whatis a variable in R-programming
variable in r storing data values
example
var<-"this is sharanya"
print(var)
sum<-"sharanya"
print(sum)
class(sum)
#2: what are strings and what are char write some example's for each of them
" " in python we called as strings
" "  in r  we called as characters
#- what are vectors create a vectors of range 20
sharanya<-c(1,2,3,4)
print(sharanya)
python <-c("sharanya","hari")
print(python)
vector i a sequence of  element which share the same data type.convert
using()
#what are numaric in R-programming
which represent the numbers and floating points

num<-c(1,2,3,4.5,6.7)
print(num)
#write some example on numaric and create a variable NUM
